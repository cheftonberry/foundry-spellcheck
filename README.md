# Foundry Spellcheck

A lightweight quality-of-life module for **Foundry Virtual Tabletop v13** that restores **native browser spellcheck and right-click spelling suggestions** while editing Journals, Actors, and Items.

Foundry suppresses the browser’s default context menu inside its editors. This module re-enables it where appropriate, allowing you to use your browser’s built-in spellchecker naturally.
